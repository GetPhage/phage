#Rules

Grab bag of rules that I'd like to manually encode for an expert
system. These are of course separate from any machine learning work.

##LAN

- identify IP subnet
- subnet should use proper network number (10/192.168/172.16.0 - 172.31.x.x)
- host addresses must be on IP subnet
- identify wifi access points
- are hosts at or near access point limits?

- LAN loop
- network partitioning

- router accessible


##Internet

- accessible
- bandwidth check
- DNS check
- IP check
- NAT check


##DHCP

- is dhcp TTL too low?
- are hosts fighting for addresses?


##Wifi

- channel collisions
- slowdown due to old versions
- gadget initialization wifi networks
- name collisions w/different channels/encryption

##mDNS

- duplicate hostnames
- hostname iteration (what exactly causes this, anyway??)

##UPNP
